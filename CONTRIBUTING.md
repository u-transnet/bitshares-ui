## Coding style guideline

Our style guideline is based on 'Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide' (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), with few exceptions:

- Strings are double quoted
- Additional trailing comma (in arrays and objects declaration) is optional
- 4 spaces tabs
- Spaces inside curly braces are optional

We strongly encourage to use _eslint_ to make sure the code adhere to our style guidelines.
